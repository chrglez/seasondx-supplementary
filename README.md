## Description

SeasonDx is a web application for the analysis of seasonality in health-related time series. It provides an interactive interface to detect, quantify and characterise seasonal structure from multiple complementary perspectives.

A live instance of the application is available at:
**https://chrglez.shinyapps.io/SeasonDx/**

## Analytical workflow

The application organises the analysis into three blocks:

1. **Decomposition & seasonal indices** — The series is decomposed into trend-cycle, seasonal and irregular components under either an additive or multiplicative specification, yielding seasonal indices together with autocorrelation-based diagnostics and the Friedman rank-sum test.

2. **Autoregressive seasonality** — An autoregressive approach based on automatic ARIMA model selection, combining Welch and Kruskal–Wallis seasonality tests with an autoregressive R² measure of seasonal strength and frequency-domain diagnostics (Bartlett's Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Fisher's Kappa tests).

3. **Two-sample difference tests** — The estimated seasonal profile is compared with a user-specified theoretical distribution through the two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Kuiper tests.
